              I started at UCF in 2016, I came in as a bio major with the "ambition" of being a physical therapist. In truth, I didn't know
              what I wanted to do, but my mom wasn't going to accept that as an answer haha. After two semesters I knew I <i>didn't</i> want
              to be a physical therapist. I hated all my classes, <strong>especially</strong> chemistry. I knew I needed to change directions,
              I googled, "degrees with good job availability." Of course CS was one of the top degrees. I had never programmed in my life, but 
              I'm always open to new things. I watched some youtube videos and coded along, "hmm this isn't so bad" I thought. I was and am by 
              no means a coding prodigy, but I worked hard to become proficient. I grew to really enjoy CS. The mathiness and rationale appeals 
              to my nerd brain. After my very first programming class Intro to C, I began
              to help others develop their coding skills as well. I became a Supplemental Instruction(SI) Leader in 2017 at UCF. I held weekly sessions
              and helped others hone their coding craft. A year later and I became a more conventional tutor, also at UCF. 
              Helping others learn has helped me create a very solid CS foundation for myself and introduced me to many great peers. 
              <br><br>
              Tutoring also showed me my calling, I love to teach. There's no better feeling than helping someone learn. But before I can teach I 
              want to be in the industry and gain some real-world experience. I want to be a developer. A project manager. A CTO. After my time in
              industry, I want to show others the magic that runs this whole planet, CS!

                      Employers can register to post jobs and view resumes. Applicants register and can view jobs they're interested in.
                      Then, they upload their resume and Watson AI blacks out their name anywhere on the resume. Once uploaded and blacked out,
                      the employer takes a look at the resume and simply judges it off of the candidate's merit. If the employer is interested 
                      they can initiate a chat through a built in messaging service. Our names can be very telling of our gender, race, and ethnicity,
                      those things shouldn't matter when you're hiring for a position.

                      I created the Firebase project and wrote a readme for everyone on the team to get on the same page, this allowed for 
                      everyone to work in parallel and test/integrate their work. I also worked on both the front-end and backend. 
                      I created the login and register pages and hooked it up to the Firebase authentication. I also hooked up the resume upload
                      and storage. Users would upload their resume and it would get sent to Firebase Storage. Metadata was stored on who the resume
                      belonged to and which jobs it had been applied to. There was a lot of learning on the fly for everyone so we weren't able to 
                      implement everything, but I'm very happy with how the result turned out.

                      Similar to a Java Arraylist, this data structure supports nth element: insertion, deletion, and retrieval. 
                      It also supports push insertion, and size trimming. <br>
                      This was a defining moment for me, it was my first large, difficult project. I ended up putting in over 40
                      hours and was able to complete every function with no memory leaks. After this project I knew this was the 
                      field for me.

                      Life is complex and unpredictable. In an untimely death, your emotions and ideas will go with you. Unless...you created
                      a Document Drop account and uploaded any documents you want distributed after an unexpected passing! Users set a check-in
                      rate of a day, a week, a month, etc. If they miss their check-in, the webapp will assume they have died and will email out 
                      any documents they uploaded to associated emails. 
                      Developed using Vue.js and Vue Native w/Bootstrap. Along with Postgres as the db, and AWS as the host server and file storage.
                      Database-backed website that holds user’s pictures and is capable of emailing photos to chosen emails.

                      <br>
                      Originally a template from Start Bootstrap and then customized to what you see now. Inspired by Pika Profession.
                      This is my second resume website, check out the first <a target="_blank" href="http://r2ro-resume.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> 
                      My first time, all the front-end was structured and designed by me which resulted in a very unrefined appearance. 
                      This time around I went with a template and made it my own. 
                      This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://startbootstrap.github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio/">orignal template.</a> 
                      <br>
                      While working with the template I've familiarized myself with using Gulp to minify scss and js files. I used 
                      Firebase to deploy the website, Firebase makes it very easy to do so. I chose Gengar as my mascot because they're 
                      my favorite pokemon. Their mischievousness and light-heartedness appeal to me, plus they look cool.

                      <h4>IBM</h4>
                      <h5>Durham, NC</h5>
                      June 15th - August 7th <br>
                      The internship was completely virtual due to COVID. I was in the IBM Blockchain department, specifically working in Hyperledger Fabric.
                      Fabric is an open source Blockchain platform used for secure and private transactions between different entities. It has many layers and
                      moving pieces so the learning curve is fairly steep, fortunately everyone was very helpful and willing to share their knowledge with me.
                      <br>
                      I spent the majority of the internship working in Fabric-Samples. Samples is in the tutorial side of Fabric. Developers 
                      interested in learning about Fabric will start in Samples to play around with sample code. I developed sample smart contracts and applications
                      for users to play around with and take a deeper look at. The samples are often used by companies as templates for their live apps and smart contracts.
                      Smart Contracts are the business logic for making transactions in a Fabric network. I developed sample smart contracts in  
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-java">Java</a> and
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-ledger-queries/chaincode-javascript">JavaScript</a>.
                      For the Java contract, I used <strong>Gradle</strong> as a build tool, and used <strong>Junit</strong> and <strong>Mockito</strong> for unit testing.
                      For both I used a test network for integration testing. After development, I would make a Github PR and have it checked out before getting 
                      merged into the main Fabric-Samples repo.
                      <br>
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="p-2">            
                    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/app.png" alt="">
                  </div>  
                  <div class="p-2">
                    <p>
                      Applications are the API for users in a Fabric network. It is how a user can access the network and invoke their smart contract.
                      I developed a couple sample applications in Java:  
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-basic/application-java">app1</a> &
                      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/tree/master/asset-transfer-ledger-queries/application-java">app2</a>.
                      I became sort of the resident Java expert in my squad. I'm by no means an expert but that was the role I fell into and I took it in stride.
                      <br>
                      Overall it was an incredible experience. I learned so much in such a short period and got to meet so many amazing people. From the 
                      people in my squad, all the way up to the CTO of the department, everyone I spoke to was open and helpful. I spoke to countless IBMers that 
                      had been at IBM their whole career, or switched into IBM and never looked back. It all speaks volumes to the culture IBM has built within
                      their company. I'm very grateful for my time there, and who knows, maybe I'll be an IBMer again down the road.

                      This was a defining moment for me, it was my first large, difficult project. I ended up putting in over 40
                      hours and was able to complete every function with no memory leaks. After this project I knew this was the 
                      field for me.

                      Life is complex and unpredictable. In an untimely death, your emotions and ideas will go with you. Unless...you created
                      a Document Drop account and uploaded any documents you want distributed after an unexpected passing! Users set a check-in
                      rate of a day, a week, a month, etc. If they miss their check-in, the webapp will assume they have died and will email out 
                      any documents they uploaded to associated emails. 
                      Developed using Vue.js and Vue Native w/Bootstrap. Along with Postgres as the db, and AWS as the host server and file storage.
                      Database-backed website that holds user’s pictures and is capable of emailing photos to chosen emails.

                      <br>
                      Originally a template from Start Bootstrap and then customized to what you see now. Inspired by Pika Profession.
                      This is my second resume website, check out the first <a target="_blank" href="http://r2ro-resume.herokuapp.com/">here.</a> 
                      My first time, all the front-end was structured and designed by me which resulted in a very unrefined appearance. 
                      This time around I went with a template and made it my own. 
                      This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://startbootstrap.github.io/startbootstrap-stylish-portfolio/">orignal template.</a> 
                      <br>
                      While working with the template I've familiarized myself with using Gulp to minify scss and js files. I used 
                      Firebase to deploy the website, Firebase makes it very easy to do so. I chose Gengar as my mascot because they're 
                      my favorite pokemon. Their mischievousness and light-heartedness appeal to me, plus they look cool.
